<p>HTML tag should be replaced by a Freemarker macro.</p>
<p>
    With Lutece v7 any HTML template should be independant from the CSS framework.
    In order to acheive this goal, basic HTML tags using CSS styles should be replaced    
    by Lutece core macros provided since version 6 that will produce dynamically 
    the correct CSS classes for the selected Framework (Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, Bulma, ...).
